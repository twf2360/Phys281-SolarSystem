This project was my introduction to programming, and so I wanted to have a permanent log of it! 

The task of Phys281 was to model a physical system, in this case the Solar System, and analyse the effectiveness of the simulation. 
V1, 2 and 3, are different iterations of the code as it improved - my version of version control before I had an idea about git! 

It's messy and it's far from efficient, but it was my first foray into this world.
